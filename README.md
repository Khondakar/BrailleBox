# BrailleBox

BrailleBox is a news reader for the visually impaired. 

# What it's made of

- A raspberry pi 3
- A breadboard
- A project box (mine is sized 150 x 80 x 50â€Šâ€”â€Šmake sure your breadboard fits in here if you want it to!)
- 5v Solenoid x 6
- Wooden balls x 6 (or something similar)
- 100Î© resistor x 7
- 1N4004 diode x 6
- Push switch
- A handful of male-to-male connector cables
- Male-to-female connector cable (for connecting the GPIO pins of the raspberry pi to the breadboard) x 7 

The great thing is that this list isnâ€™t too extensive and all of these components can be found for pretty cheap. The most expensive are the solenoids, but 5V ones can be picked up for around Â£2.50 each ðŸ™‚

And with the electronically components from this put together into a circuit, the schematics for the complete circuit isnâ€™t too complex either:
